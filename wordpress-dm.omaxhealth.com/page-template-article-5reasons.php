					<p>Supplements are not like over-the-counter drugs. You could buy any number of ibuprofen brands and know that you are getting 200mg per tablet just by reading the label. But would it surprise you to know that the same doesn't apply to your supplements? The quality of what you are getting changes dramatically depending on the brand- which is why it's important to do your research before going all-in on a product.</p>

					 <p>Take fish oils, the most widely taken supplement for your daily dose of omega-3s. What would you say if we told you that the fish oils in your house only contain 30% of omega-3 per softgel?</p>
					 <p>So what's in the rest of it? Saturated fat, that's what.</p>
					 <p>That's why, after doing our research, we were so excited to discover Omax3. All the benefits you think you might be getting with your drugstore brand fish oil, Omax3 blows them out of the water. Here are 5 reasons we highly suggest switching to Omax3:</p>

					<h2>1) It's Pure. Really Pure.</h2>
					<p>Remember that 30% statistic we just gave you? <strong>Omax3 is exceptionally concentrated at 93.9%.</strong> Using a state-of-the-art process, the omega-3 oils are double-molecular distilled and cold-pressed for exceptional purity, removing unsafe levels of saturated fats, impurities and toxins.</p>

				<div class="column">
					<h2>2) It's Patented with a Special Formula.</h2>
					<p>Developed by Yale-affiliated scientists, <strong>the patented ProResolv Forumla allows Omax3 to contain 4x more EPA than DHA</strong>, the omega-3s most responsible for fighting inflammation in the body. This optimal 4-to-1 balance can help support joint comfort, muscle recovery, heart health, mood, and cognition.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<h2>3) It's Sourced from High-Quality</h2>
					<p>Omax3 is derived from the richest source of omega-3 in the world: <strong>premium-quality, wild-caught anchovies and sardines, harvested off the coast of Peru.</strong> Omax3 is certified by Friends of the Sea, which ensures our fisheries follow strict, and sustainable marine practices.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<h2>4) It's Third-Party Tested.</h2>
					<p><strong>Omax3 conforms to the highest standards of manufacturing for the dietary supplement industry.</strong> NSF verifies the identity and quantity of ingredients on the label, and each batch obtains two certificates of analysis to ensure purity and concentration.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<h2>5) Blister Packs, People.</h2>
					<p>So easy and yes so effective. Each Omax3 softgel is individually packed in a seal-tight blister pack, so it doesn't oxidize and remains fresh. By protecting each softgel, there is no fishy smell or taste. That means <strong>no more "fishy burps".</strong></p>
