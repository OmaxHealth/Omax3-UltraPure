					<p>One approach that has risen to prominence is the Keto diet, and for good reason. <strong>The Keto diet approaches weight loss from a very smart, scientifically backed method.</strong></p>
					<p>In a nutshell: When you consume carbs, your body produces glucose, which it will then convert to use as energy. However, because glucose is being used as the primary energy source, your body will take unneeded fats and store them away resulting in, well...fat.</p>
					<p>By lowering your carb intake your body will enter a state known as "ketosis" and burn ketones as the primary energy source. This is where you start weight loss benefits, as well as increased physical and mental performance.</p>

					<h2>Omega-3s Amp Up Keto Diet</h2>
					<p>However, recent studies have shown that a hack does exist to maximize these benefits. <strong>By upping your omega-3 intake, you can give your Keto diet a well-needed boost.</strong> The reason is actually pretty simple. Not only do people who regularly consume omega-3 fatty acids generally have a lower body fat percentage, but by pairing your omega-3 intake with a Keto diet, researchers have found that triglyceride levels have seriously decreased.</p>

					<p>In a recent study, overweight patients were asked to stick to a Keto diet for four weeks. <strong>At the conclusion of the study, the individuals who took fish oils during the diet saw an almost 20% decrease in their triglyceride levels.(1)</strong></p>

					<p>These are results you can't look past. But to really take advantage of these findings, finding the right fish oils are key. <strong>We highly recommend Omax3.</strong> It's highly concentrated with omega-3 fatty acids, coming in at a <strong>whopping 93.3%</strong> pure compared to the 30% you'll find in the top selling fish oil at the local drug store.</p>

It can also act as a natural anti-inflammatory, which can support joint and cardiovascular health. The list goes on and on.</p>
