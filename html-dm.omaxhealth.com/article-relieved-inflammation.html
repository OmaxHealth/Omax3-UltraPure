					<p>Being a musician, my hands are invaluable to me. After 30 plus years of playing hours a day, I began to develop arthritis in my hands. At first, temporary pain management was fine, but as the years passed, flare-ups were becoming far too frequent. I was taking ibuprofen and aspirin every single day, so I decided to look for a real solution.</p>
					<p>By doing some research, I learned that taking omega-3 supplements can resolve inflammation issues in the body – the root of many health and aging issues. At that point, I just needed the best product available, and that is Omax3 Ultra-Pure.</p>

					<h2>1) Why I Decided to Try Omax3</h2>
					<p>I was having a real problem with mobility in my hands, it was affecting my livelihood. I wanted the absolute best product available to me. When I considered what was on the market, it was obvious I wouldn’t get a more pure or potent Omega-3 than Omax3 Ultra-Pure. Since I started taking a daily dose, my flare-ups have become almost non-existent, I know it’s because of Omax3.</p>

					<h2>2) What About Other Types of Omega Products?</h2>
					<p>Omega-3 products are abundant and easy to find, but I wanted the best. It was clear with just a little research that most store-bought Omega-3s were low potency at only 30% and not from the best sources. After filtering through all the noise, is was obvious that Omax3 Ultra-Pure, at 93.9% pure Omega-3 is the most tested supplement on the market with the most proven results, the choice was simple.</p>

					<h2>4) Why I Prefer Omax3</h2>
					<p>Omax3 Ultra-Pure is easily the most potent and cleanest Omega-3 product I have ever taken. Within just days, I was feeling the positive effects I was looking for, something I have yet to experience with any other supplement. My hands feel youthful again.</p>
					<p>I know with Omax3, I am getting the highest potency available on the market. It gets into my system and starts working right away. Plus, each pill is blister packed to guarantee freshness, something that is overlooked with most fish oil products. It’s a premium product and it’s obvious from the results, I would never put anything but the best supplements into my body. Omax3 Ultra-Pure is at the very top of the list for Omega-3s.</p>
